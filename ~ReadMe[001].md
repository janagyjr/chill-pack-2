# TCG's Chill Pack - Part Deux  

Well I have made another Chill Pack and this one is even better than my aweseom 1.7.10 pack (which you can find [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tcgs-chill-pack)). Bringing back favorites like Moo Fluids, Galacticraft, and Minefactory Reloaded, and adding in fun mods like Mekanism, SG Craft, and ViesCraft!  

With easy resource production, fun porting around mods, and some new dimensions, Chill Pack Part Deux is sure to give you the challenges you crave while still allowing you to just sit back, relax, and engage in epic building projects!
